# text-based-game-engine

game engine for a text-adventure based game. Sample material is included and was used for testing. Built using gcc through CLion.
Save.txt allows a user to load and save their progress including where they are, objects across rooms and objects in inventory. The use of 'blorb, slorb, jorb' is to confuse users trying to cheat.
